Building libraries
------------------
Just execute the provided buildlibs.sh script:

./buildlibs.sh libdir

For example, if you want to build ImageMagick,

./buildlibs.sh imagick


The ROOT variable must have to be correctly set.
To do so, source the env.sh script 
("source env.sh" or ". env.sh" commands)
